CRUD in Assembly? Yes, it has! Check it out! 

Of course, that is totally unfeasible and contraindicated, but it´s possible:

Assembly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in assembly language can be a lot of complex and depend on platform-specific.
But, for you to check is possible, see this simplified example of how you might approach CRUD operations in x86 assembly for a simulated array of integers.

In this example, I´m using a x86 assembly for Linux (int 0x80), and may require modification if you're using a different assembly language or platform.
Please, pay attention, because this simple example doesn't include error handling or complex data structures that you might encounter in a real-world application.

Of course, to comprehend the whole code in this example you need to have a basic understanding of assembly language. But, you can see how much this is complex.

I started my career in this era after I passed to Cobol. I think that in every programming language, I already put my hands (lol)
